# Project-AI-Detect-object
I use YOLO.V8 to create this project it can detect object human(age , gender , emotion) but maybe wrong sometime about detect object and i add about fake ghost prank. The ghost can show when your cam detect human lol.

## Age and Gender Prediction Model

The age and gender prediction models u can find (`age_net.caffemodel`, `gender_net.caffemodel`,`gender_deploy.prototxt`,`age_deploy.prototxt`) used in this project are obtained from the "Age-Gender-Prediction" repository by Ritvik Pandey.
* **Original Repository:** [https://github.com/ritvik03/Age-Gender-Prediction](https://github.com/ritvik03/Age-Gender_Prediction)

## YOLO.V8n

"YOLO.V8n" u can download from "ultralytics github"
* **Original Repository:** [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/docs/en/models/yolov8.md](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/docs/en/models/yolov8.md)


## How to do this 
-******-
I use " Visual studio Code " python
U should have "  6 file "  in ur folder  
** 1-4  --->  (`age_net.caffemodel`, `gender_net.caffemodel`,`gender_deploy.prototxt`,`age_deploy.prototxt`)
** 5    --->  YOLO.V8n 
** 6    ---> my file "Detect Object code.py "
u can open it on VScode and click my file "Detect Object code.py "
and install library 
** pip install opencv-python
** pip install tensorflow
** pip install opencv-contrib-python
** pip install ultralytics
** pip insrall fer
** pip install moviepy==1.0.3
yes it will be finished if dont have something wrong!!!
